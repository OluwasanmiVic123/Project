Htaccess is short for Hypertext Access. It is a configuration file used by apache-based web servers.

Configuration files configure the initial settings of a program, or in this case the server. This means that the .htaccess file can be used to make the server behave in a certain way. Each function is basically just a line of text, or code, which tells the server what to do. You can add or change functionality by adding or changing the code in the .htaccess file.

.htaccess IS USED FOR

- Protect your site with a password.
- Create a custom-made error page.
- Redirect visitors to another page.
